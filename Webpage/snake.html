            <h2>ABOUT THE GAME:</h2>
            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <p>The game snake is played using the arrow keys. The arrow keys define the direction in which the snake will be going. Use Numpad 0 to turn 'ON' or 'OFF' the autoplay.</p>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The objective of this game is to eat the food and stay alive as long as possible. If you crash into the wall or yourself, the snake will die however the games become more and more chalanging as the game proceds since each block of food increases the length of the snake by one.</p>
            <h2>CODE SNIPTS:</h2>
            <h3>Player</h3>
            <p>The player is defaulted in the centre of the screen with the direction upward. The function player draws the blocks onto the screen using the rect method defined in the draw class in pygame framework.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>playerPos = [[300, 300], [300, 320], [300, 340]]</p>
                <p>dir = 'u'</p>
                <p>def player(pos):</p>
                <p>&emsp;for x in pos:</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;pygame.draw.rect(screen, (225, 225, 225), pygame.Rect(x[0], x[1], 20, 20))</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Food</h3>
            <p>The values of axis for placing of food is selected at random using the random library. The is a variable eaten which is defauted to be False and tells if the food is eaten by the snake or not. And there after an function blits an image loaded into the program using the load method in image class.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>foodimg = pygame.image.load('fruit.png')</p>
                <p>foodX = random.randint(1,30) * 20</p>
                <p>foodY = random.randint(1,30) * 20</p>
                <p>eaten = False</p>
                <p>def add_food(x,y):</p>
                <p>&emsp;screen.blit(foodimg, (x, y))</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Crashing</h3>
            <p>Checking if the snake has crashed is made by creating a function which takes the list of player position as its parameter. It checks if the head of the snake is overlapping over its body or if it is out of the screen bounds. It returns True in case the snake has crashed and returns False if not.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>def crash(pos):</p>
                <p>&emsp;l = [pos[x] for x in range(1, len(pos))]</p>
                <p>&emsp;if pos[0] in l:</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;return True</p>
                <p>&emsp;elif (pos[0][0] >= 620) or (pos[0][0] &#60; 20) or (pos[0][1] >= 620) or (pos[0][1] &#60; 20):</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;return True</p>
                <p>&emsp;else:</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;return False</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Autoplay</h3>
            <p>The auto play function is made using a lot of if, elif and else statements. It checks the 4 blocks surrounding to its head and takes decision based on it.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>def self(dir, foodX, foodY, playerPos):</p>
