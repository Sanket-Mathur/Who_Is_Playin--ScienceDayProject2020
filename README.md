# Who_Is_Playin--ScienceDayProject2020
This is the project made by me for the exhibition on the science day in my college. It consists of a GUI main.py consisting 5 buttons. 4 of which activates different games while 1 is linked to the website. You can either play the games yourself or let the computer play using the self solving algorithm.
This project is built in unbuntu so you might have to edit the subprocess calls depending on your OS.
You need to have python installed and the pygame framework in order for it to run.
I have tried it on PyCharm IDE and VSCode TextEditor and it runs fine on both with all the requirements installed.
